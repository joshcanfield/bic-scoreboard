  notes: >
    Messages follow a JSON envelope `{ "event": string, "data": any }`. Outbound `update`
    events mirror the REST `GET /game` payload with an extra `buzzerOn` flag; outbound `power`
    events carry `{ "scoreboardOn": boolean }`. Inbound events include `goal`, `shot`,
    `undo_goal`, `undo_shot`, `clock_start`, `clock_pause`, `set_period`, `exit_intermission`, `buzzer`, `power`,
    `power_on`, `power_off`, `power_state`, and `createGame` (see `components/schemas/WebSocketEventPayloads`).
